# Foison: receipt scanner for iOS & Android

Snap a photo of any receipt (groceries, pharmacy, fuel, dining). Foison reads every line item and price,
shows them to you right away for a quick review, then saves the receipt on the phone and adds it to a
Google Sheet in the user's own Google Drive.

```
mobile/   Expo (React Native) app for iPhone and Android, TypeScript, Expo Router
server/   Small Node API that reads receipt photos with Claude (keeps the API key off the phone)
```

## How it works

1. **Sign in with Google** (native Google Sign-In). The app asks only for the `drive.file` scope, so it can
   create and edit *its own* spreadsheet and never sees the user's other Drive files.
2. **Scan**: take one photo, or for a **long receipt** several photos top to bottom (up to 8), or pick
   several from the library. On the device each photo is resized, and tall photos are sliced into
   overlapping full-resolution sections (see `mobile/src/lib/tiling.ts`) so small print stays readable.
   Claude reads images at up to 2576 px on the long edge, so one photo of a 60 cm receipt would otherwise be
   shrunk to an unreadable ~400 px wide. All parts (max 12) go to `POST /v1/receipts/parse` in one request
   with the user's Google ID token.
3. **Server** verifies the token, rate-limits per user, and asks Claude (vision + structured JSON output)
   for merchant, date, currency, items (name, qty, unit price, line total, category), tax and total.
   The parts are labelled in order and Claude is told to merge them and count lines that appear in two
   overlapping parts only once. The reply is streamed with room for 64k output tokens, so receipts with
   hundreds of lines are not cut off.
4. **Review** shows every item and price immediately. Tap an item to fix it; a warning appears if the items
   don't add up to the printed total.
5. **Save** writes to a local SQLite database first (works offline), then syncs to Google Sheets:
   - A spreadsheet named **Foison Receipts** is created on first sync, with two tabs:
     `Receipts` (one row per receipt) and `Items` (one row per item).
   - Both rows are written in one atomic `batchUpdate`, and the receipt ID is checked first, so retries
     never create duplicates.
   - Failed syncs (offline, expired token) are retried when the app returns to the foreground, on
     pull-to-refresh, or from Settings → Sync now.

## Setup

### 1. Google Cloud (one-time)

In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. Create a project and **enable the Google Sheets API**.
2. Configure the **OAuth consent screen** (External). Add the scope
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`. It is a non-sensitive scope, so no security assessment is needed.
3. Create **OAuth client IDs**:
   - **Web application**: used as `webClientId` (this is the audience of the ID tokens the server checks).
   - **iOS**: bundle ID = `IOS_BUNDLE_ID`.
   - **Android**: package = `ANDROID_PACKAGE`, plus the **SHA-1** of your signing key
     (`eas credentials` shows it; add both the upload key and the Play App Signing key).

### 2. Server

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env    # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:8787
npm test
```

Deploy anywhere that runs Node 20+ or Docker (Fly.io, Railway, Render, Cloud Run):

```bash
docker build -t foison-server ./server
docker run -p 8787:8787 --env-file server/.env foison-server
```

It must be served over **HTTPS** in production. The rate limiter is in-memory; if you run more than one
instance, move it to Redis.

### 3. Mobile app

```bash
cd mobile
cp .env.example .env    # API URL + Google client IDs + bundle IDs
npm install
```

Google Sign-In and the camera use native code, so the app runs in a **development build**, not Expo Go:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build --profile development --platform ios      # or android
npx expo start --dev-client
```

(With Xcode / Android Studio installed you can use `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android` instead.)

Checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test
```

### 4. Release to the App Store and Google Play

1. Store the `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`, `IOS_BUNDLE_ID` and `ANDROID_PACKAGE` values as EAS environment variables
   for the `production` environment (`eas env:create`), or keep them in `.env` for local builds.
2. `npx eas-cli@latest build --profile production --platform all`
3. `npx eas-cli@latest submit --platform ios` / `--platform android`
4. Replace the placeholder icon and splash images in `mobile/assets/` with your brand.
5. Publish a privacy policy. Receipt photos are sent to your server and to Anthropic for processing; the
   server does not store them.
